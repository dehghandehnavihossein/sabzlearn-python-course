    "## **Definition of an Algorithm**\n",
    "An algorithm is a **step-by-step** procedure for solving a problem, with a **defined order** of execution. It has a **starting point** and an **ending point**, and may include loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Solving a problem is important, but *how* you solve it matters even more.\n",

    "6. It should handle **edge cases** effectively.\n",
    "7. Consider the **order of mathematical operations**.\n",
